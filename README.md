# Instructions:

(1) Create new repository named "python-challenge" exclusively for this project

(2) Clone the repository on your computer

(3) Within the local repository, create folders for each Python assignment: PyBank and PyPoll

(4) Add the files to each folder:

(i) **main.py**: The main script to run for analysis

(ii) **Resources folder**: Containing the CSV files (budget_data.csv and election_data.csv)

(iii) **Analysis folder**: To store text files with analysis results.

# Main concept tested:

**1) CSV file handling, data reading and processing**
  - Read/write data from/to CSV files with Python
  - ‘open’
  - ‘with … as’
  - ‘os.path.join’
    
**2) Variables, functions and basic math (total, averages, %)**

**3) Conditional statements**

**4) Loops**
- ‘for … in’
- 
**6) GitHub**
-	Use the command line to access files and folders and to update GitHub repositories
- Add
- Commit
- Push

# Journey for PyBank challenges

# Journey for PyPoll challenges
(1) Reviewed notes in Python class 1 - 3 before start

(2) Total of vote: use vote counter +=

(3) Individual vote count: Create a list for the Candidate names, if the Candidate name is not on the list, add his/her name to the list, along with a vote for his/her name. But if he/she is already on the list, then simply add a vote count under his/her name

*In previous Module 2, If Not Equal (<>) in VBA is utilized to check if we are still within the same ticker, and it played an important role during the For Loop value searches.*

To find out if Python has conditional statements like "if not", I looked up online and found W3Schools Python Tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_if_not.asp
